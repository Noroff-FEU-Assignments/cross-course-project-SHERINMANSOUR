        A cybersecurity framework is a strategic approach that begins with detailed research on security risks and includes activities such as developing a cyber incident response plan along with suitable application security checklists. The bigger the organization, the more such a strategic approach is needed.

        [<h3 id="Use https">Use Https </h3>
        <p>Configure your web server to use HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HTTPS encrypts data sent between your client and server. This ensures that login credentials, cookies, POST requests data and header information are not easily available to attackers.
            Keep track of the most popular threats (the current OWASP list is here) and address the most common vulnerabilities first.

            <h3 id="Use diverse security measures">Use diverse security measures</h3>
            <p> According to Tomasz Andrzej Nidecki  Some businesses believe that the best way to protect against web-related threats is to use a web application firewall (WAF). However, a WAF is just a band-aid tool that eliminates potential attack vectors. While a WAF is an important part of a complete security suite for an enterprise and the best way to handle zero-day vulnerabilities through virtual patching, it should not be treated as the most important line of defense.
                All in all, you should use diverse security measures, but you should not just believe that purchasing them and giving them to your security team will solve the problem. These security measures must be integrated with your entire environment and automated as much as possible. They are there to reduce the amount of work that the security team has, not increase it.

                <h3>Consider two-factor authentication for your site</h3>
                <p>Use more effective password management. Encourage strong passwords. Consider two-factor authentication for your site, so that in addition to a password the user must enter another authentication code (usually one that is delivered via some physical hardware that only the user will have, such as a code in an SMS sent to their phone).
                    <h3>Update to the latest version</h3>
                    <p>Keep software updated: make sure that all software, including the operating system, web server, and content management system, are up-to-date with the latest security version.
